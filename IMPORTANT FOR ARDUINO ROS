The "Hello World" example seems to be working fine. The only change you must to your Arduino code on Micro or just the normal one, I only have a Micro is to add

#define USE_USBCON

just before

#include <ros.h>


This Section maybe useful

We just made SerialClient.py do the same:

self.port = Serial(port, baud, timeout=self.timeout*0.5)
changes to

self.port = Serial(port, 0, timeout=self.timeout*0.5)
self.port.baudrate = baud
time.sleep(2.0) # give usb chip time to reset
